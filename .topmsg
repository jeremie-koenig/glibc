	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/bits/stat.h (struct stat): Align to what is done
	for Linux: use nsec instead of usec, as well as:
	[__USE_MISC] (st_atim, st_mtim, st_ctim): Provide these ``struct
	timespec''s.
	(struct stat64): Likewise.
	(_STATBUF_ST_NSEC): Define.
	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/xstatconv.c (xstat64_conv): Adapt to that.

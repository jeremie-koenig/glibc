Subject: [PATCH] bits_atomic.h_multiple_threads

TODO.  bits/atomic.h for GNU Hurd.
    
Source: Debian, eglibc-2.10/debian/patches/hurd-i386/local-atomic-no-multiple_threads.diff, r3536.
Author: TBD.

We always at least start the sigthread anyway.  For now, let's avoid forking
the file (which would mean having to maintain it).

Need to override sysdeps/i386/i486/bits/atomic.h to remove Linuxisms.
